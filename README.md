### Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.


### Functionality

this is a landing page showing navigation bar and 6 sections:
1. creating the nav bar dynamically according to the number of sections
2. when scrolling class "your-active-class" is located to the section presented in the current view and highlights its corresponding link in the nav bar 
3. if the view isn't scrolled for a certain time "1500 milliseconds" the nav bar will disappear
4. when clicking on any link in the nav bar it scrolls to the intended section
5. it calculates the performance of the code in milliseconds.
